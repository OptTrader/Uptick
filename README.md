## Uptick

## Synopsis

A simple, beautifully designed stock app where users can monitor their watchlist, get key financial information including charts, follow news and tweets from StockTwits community.

Uptick can be found on the App Store - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uptick-free-stock-watchlist/id1189867641?mt=8

## Background

As a life-long investor, I actively find ideas to trade stocks and options from my comprehensive spreadsheet models. The models include the ability to search and filter out a list of stocks that I keep track off. It also has some option pricing model and trade structures.  

I always wanted to build an app that incorporate these features from my model. Uptick represents the starting point of a product road map to achieve this goal.

While the app is a simple app, it does showcase my ability to work with REST Api / JSON including the following sources:
* Yahoo Finance Api
* Chart Api
* Yahoo RSS
* Stock Twits

Lastly, I spent a lot of time to work on the UI part of the app. The design lessons I gained from **Design+Code** has strong influence on this app.

## Installation

1. pod install

## Update Issue

Chart API seems to be not working anymore. I might need to look for other free web service that provides data for the charts.

## For The Future

I plan to release the version of Uptick to include the following:
* Foreign Currency/FX
* Bitcoin
* Indices
* Expanded view of each Stockâ€™s tweets
* Possibly candlestick chart
